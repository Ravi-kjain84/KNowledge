Subject: Initiating Discussions on TCOE

Hi

I hope you are doing well.

Just to update you, Muthu has shared the news of my transition with the team today. As I start preparing for the TCOE role, I wanted to align with you on a few areas I plan to focus on in the coming weeks. I’d appreciate your guidance and suggestions on how best to proceed:
	1.	Gaining an understanding of the ongoing testing work across various projects.
	2.	Familiarizing myself with the ongoing FDSS project (I have a meeting scheduled with Bhanu next Wednesday for this).
	3.	Gathering the test cases currently in use across different projects to categorize them based on stakeholder requirements, moving toward creating structured test packages.
	4.	Reviewing any existing testing automation frameworks or tools currently in use.

In parallel, I’ve started exploring the Raft tool and have some ideas on how it could be leveraged further for other testing scenarios. I’d love to hear your thoughts on this as well.

Looking forward to your guidance as I get started.

Thank you,
[Your Name]
